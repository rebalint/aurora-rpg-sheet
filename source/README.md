# TODO LIST

- move files to src and start tracking release config compile results  
- add race, classes, magic, etc
    - load data for these from some sort of config file
        - create an editor for this file maybe?
- save+load
- make everything responsive and tidy up UI in general

- add proper readme
- transfer in-line to-dos here if needed

- eventually: learn testing on this
